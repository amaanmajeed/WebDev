# Web Development Journey

A website that documents my journey of learning web development. The repository contains links to each of the websites I have built, along with the HTML and CSS code for each one.

## Features
- View websites: Each website has a link that allows you to view it in your browser.
- View HTML and CSS code: There are buttons on the top right-hand side of each website that allow you to view the HTML and CSS code for that website.

## Requirements
- You can run the website online. No need to install it.
